$ awk '/a/ {print $4 "\t" $3}' marks.txt

$ awk 'length($0) > 18' marks.txt

Regular expressions:

$ echo -e "This\nThat\nThere\nTheir\nthese" | awk '/^The/'

$ echo -e "Call\nTall\nBall" | awk '/[CT]all/'

$ echo -e "ca\ncat\ncatt" | awk '/cat*/'

CODE Excecution:

#Redirect these outputs to files and look at the files

$ awk 'BEGIN {
   fruits["mango"] = "yellow";
   fruits["orange"] = "orange"
   print fruits["orange"] "\n" fruits["mango"]
}'

$ awk 'BEGIN {
   num = 11; if (num % 2 == 0) printf "%d is even number.\n", num; 
      else printf "%d is odd number.\n", num 
}'
