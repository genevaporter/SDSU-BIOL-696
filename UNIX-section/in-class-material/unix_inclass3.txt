Exercise: 
(1) Write a simple bash script and make it executable
(2) Make a more complex bash script and test it
(3) Move the bash script to a directory in your permanent path

First, make sure to have a zipped file ready. Copy Dprob1.txt to a file called 'tmp' 
then use gzip to compress it. You should have tmp.gz at the end.

(1) Write simple script with an if/then

a. Make a script called store_data.sh that asks the user for a file name, checks to see if the file exists, then echos the name of the file.
b. Make the file executable (chmod 755 is one way) and execute it.

(2) Improve the script
If the file exists the bash script should
  1. Make a directory called SEQDATA
  2. Move the file to SEQDATA
  3. Unzip the file in SEQDATA
  4. Run head on the file

(3) Try moving the script to /usr/local/bin
