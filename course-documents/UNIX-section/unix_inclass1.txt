Make sure Dprob1.txt is in your home directory.
You should see the file when you open a terminal a type 'ls' enter.
$ls

Try the following commands. After running each set of commands
write/type what you think is happening. Each line is a different command.

1) Directory contents

ls
ls -a
ls -l
ls -al #look carefully at this output. Do you understand it?

2) Files and directories

mkdir TMP
ls
cp Dprob1.txt Dprob1_copy.txt
ls
mv Dprob1_copy.txt TMP/
cd TMP
ls

3) Moving around - use the 'pwd' command to see where you are: 

cd
cd TMP
cd .
cd ..
cd TMP
cd ~
cd /
ls
cd

4) Fun with files! Use 'ls -al' to see the files.

cd TMP
cp Dprob1.txt tmp.txt
cat tmp.txt
cat Dprob1.txt tmp.txt > bigfile.txt
ls -al   #What happened here?
mv bigfile.txt bigfile
gzip bigfile
ls -al #What happened to bigfile?

5) Looking at files

head bigfile
tail bigfile
less bigfile # Use spacebar and b, q to quit

6) Finding crap in files - what is happening?

grep 'RL' bigfile
grep 'RL' -c bigfile
cd ..
grep -r 'RL' -c TMP/

7) Getting rid of files or directories

rm bigfile
cd ..
rm TMP  #did this work?
rm -r TMP
